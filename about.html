            <p>My name is William Egge and I live in Virginia, near D.C.</p>

              My first hobby is video games. I have enjoyed playing games since
              I was a kid, but I also enjoy making them as well. I am not very
              good at writing compelling stories or interesting characters, but
              I love making fun gameplay loops that reward skill and dedication.

              My second hobby is animation. I have never been very good at any
              form of art, but I recently started learning pixel art and simple
              animations last Christmas. I am still a beginner at it and I would
              say that I have a lot of practice to do before I create anything
              good. However, it is my favorite visual art an art form, given how
              much easier it is to control space and color.
